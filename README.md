# RomSort #

RomSort is a small open-source app to take a directory of files and sort them into alphabetical sub-folders. It was designed to assist the organization of ROM collections which will be browsed on low-resolution screens that limit the number of files visible at once.

RomSort is developed in C# for .NET 2.0.
